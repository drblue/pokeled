# PokeLED

Quick hack connecting a specific Pokemon Go-gym's owning team with a [Blinkstick](https://www.blinkstick.com/) (USB-connected multi-color LED-strip).

## Installation

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and enter your [Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC)](https://club.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-trainer-club/sign-up/) account credentials *(use a dummy-account, not the one you're actively playing with!)*.

## Usage

Run `poke.js` with whatever node-runner you like (just plain old `node`, perhaps `nodemon` or `forever`, or why not the awesome `pm2`). A sample `ecosystem.json` for `pm2` is included as I use it to deploy to my Raspberry Pi v1 which has the Blinkstick connected to it in my bedroom window.
